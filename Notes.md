Session: A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database.
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_sessions.htm

SessionFactory.openSession() always opens a new session 
that you have to close once you are done with the operations. 

SessionFactory.getCurrentSession() returns a session bound to a context - 
you don't need to close this.

Transaction: In hibernate framework, we have Transaction interface that defines the unit of work. 
It maintains abstraction from the transaction implementation (JTA,JDBC).
Within the transaction, you execute various database operations like 
querying, updating, inserting, or deleting records.
